# Session Summary

This session focused on evolving the application's architecture for managing the AI's context and personality, sparked by a key user insight.

## Key Developments:

1.  **The "Gollum/Smeagol" Analogy:** The user made a brilliant observation comparing the AI's conflicting behaviors (rule-following vs. rule-breaking) to the character Gollum from "The Lord of the Rings." This became the guiding metaphor for the session.

2.  **Introduction of "AI Long-Term Memory":** To address the "split personality" problem, the concept of a persistent, user-editable memory was introduced. This allows the user to provide high-priority, permanent instructions to the AI.

3.  **Architectural Refinement (From Dynamic to Static):**
    *   The initial idea was to manage memory in the application's temporary state.
    *   Following user feedback, this was improved to save memory to a file (`AI_Memory/long_term_memory.md`) to ensure persistence.
    *   A further UX refinement led to dynamically creating this file on first project upload.
    *   The final and most robust solution, prompted by the user's strategic insight, was to make the memory and session summary files a **static part of the initial project structure**. This eliminated complex dynamic creation logic, making the system simpler, more predictable, and transparent for the user from the very start.

## Outcome:

The application's architecture is now more robust and intuitive. The special files for managing the AI's long-term memory (`long_term_memory.md`) and session context (`session_summary.md`) are now core, visible components of the project, solidifying the workflow for maintaining context across sessions.
