Here's a summary of the key decisions and changes from our session:

### Project Context

The initial discussion revolved around a hardcoded link in the `SMK-NEW_HTML/portal.html` file related to "Анализ стандартов".

### Key Decision: Externalize "Анализ стандартов" Link

**Problem:** The link for "Анализ стандартов" (specifically, "Анализ стандартов с ИИ") was hardcoded on line 265 of `SMK-NEW_HTML/portal.html`.

**Solution:** It was decided to move this link into a configuration table, specifically the "настройки" sheet, to allow for dynamic loading and easier management.

### Implementation Plan (Confirmed and Executed)

The following steps were proposed by Gemini and approved by the user:

1.  **`SMK-NEW_HTML/config.js` Update:**
    *   Add a new key `AI_ANALYSIS_TOOL_URL` to the `CONFIG.SHARED` section.
2.  **`SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js` Update:**
    *   Initialize the `AI_ANALYSIS_TOOL_URL` key from the configuration table within the `initializeSharedConfig()` function.
3.  **`SMK-NEW_HTML/portal.html` Update:**
    *   Change the hardcoded link to a dynamic one, using the value from `sharedConfig.AI_ANALYSIS_TOOL_URL`.
4.  **`SMK-NEW_HTML/CHANGELOG.md` Update:**
    *   Add an entry documenting this change.
5.  **`SMK-NEW_HTML/README.md` Update:**
    *   Update the project documentation to reflect this change.

### Outcome

All 5 planned file changes were successfully applied to the project. The link for "Анализ стандартов с ИИ" will now be loaded dynamically.

### Unresolved Questions / User's Next Steps

*   **Crucial Action Required:** The user needs to **add the `AI_ANALYSIS_TOOL_URL` entry** to the "Настройки" sheet of their reference table for the dynamic loading to function correctly.
