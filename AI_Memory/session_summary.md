This document summarizes the key interactions, decisions, and code changes made during the session.

## Project Initialization

The session began with the successful upload of project files in several batches:
*   Initial load: 2 files
*   First update: 8 files
*   Second update: 21 files
*   Third update: 28 files

## Issue 1: File Naming Convention (`0_config.js`, `1_utilities.js`)

*   **Problem:** The user questioned the unusual naming of `0_config.js` and `1_utilities.js`.
*   **Gemini's Explanation:** These names were a temporary workaround for `ReferenceError: CONFIG is not defined` in Google Apps Script. Files sometimes load alphabetically, and numerical prefixes ensured `0_config.js` loaded first, followed by `1_utilities.js`, before other dependent files.
*   **User's Request:** The user requested a proper design fix rather than just renaming, to eliminate the underlying cause.
*   **Decision & Solution:** Gemini proposed and implemented the following:
    1.  Rename `SMK-NEW_HTML/0_config.js` to `SMK-NEW_HTML/config.js`.
    2.  Rename `SMK-NEW_HTML/1_utilities.js` to `SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js`.
    3.  Move the `initializeSharedConfig()` call from the end of `SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js` to the beginning of the `doGet()` function in `SMK-NEW_HTML/Code.js` to ensure `CONFIG` is defined early.
    4.  Update `SMK-NEW_HTML/README.md` and `SMK-NEW_HTML/CHANGELOG.md` to reflect these changes and remove mentions of the temporary workaround.
*   **Files Changed:**
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/0_config.js` (renamed)
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/1_utilities.js` (renamed)
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/Code.js` (code modification)
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/README.md`
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/CHANGELOG.md`
*   **Outcome:** 7 file changes were applied.

## Issue 2: Compatibility with Old Project Data (Missing Folder ID)

*   **Problem:** The user reported an error when trying to edit an old project (form 081-01) to "отклонен" status. The system could not find the "ID Папки проекта" because old project entries did not populate this column, only providing a URL in the "Папка проекта" column. The new code expected the dedicated ID column to be present.
*   **User's Request:** The code needs to handle both old project rows (with only a folder URL) and new project rows (with a dedicated folder ID).
*   **Decision & Solution:** Gemini proposed and implemented a change to `SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js`. The `getProjectDataById_` function was modified to extract the "ID Папки проекта" directly from the folder URL (in the "Папка проекта" column) if the dedicated "ID Папки проекта" field is empty.
*   **Files Changed:**
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js` (code modification)
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/CHANGELOG.md`
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/README.md`
*   **Outcome:** 3 file changes were applied.

## Issue 3: Syntax Error Regression (`utilities.gs`)

*   **Problem:** After the previous changes, the user encountered a `Syntax error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<<' line: 543 file: utilities.gs` during `clasp push`. This indicated a merge conflict marker or incorrect symbol was introduced.
*   **Gemini's Apology & Explanation:** Gemini acknowledged the error as a fault in not thoroughly checking the code after generating changes.
*   **Decision & Solution:** Gemini proposed and implemented an immediate fix. The content of `SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js` was replaced with a corrected version, ensuring all previous valid changes were preserved and the syntax error was removed.
*   **Files Changed:**
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/utilities.js` (code correction)
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/CHANGELOG.md`
    *   `SMK-NEW_HTML/README.md`
*   **Outcome:** 3 file changes were applied.

## Final Resolution

*   **User Confirmation:** The user confirmed that the fix worked: "Работает. Спасибо."
*   **Gemini's Response:** Gemini expressed satisfaction that the problem was resolved.
