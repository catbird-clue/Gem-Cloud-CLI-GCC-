### Session Summary: Project Status & Form Logic Refinements

This session focused on debugging and refining the logic for project status changes, particularly in the context of Nonconformance Protocols (Form 086) and Complaints (Form 085), as well as ensuring data integrity for file attachments.

#### Key Decisions & Actions:

1.  **Initial Form 086 Error Fix:**
    *   **Problem:** User encountered a `ReferenceError: hasOpenPN is not defined` when submitting Form 086.
    *   **Fix:** Replaced the undeclared variable `hasOpenPN` with `hasOpenNonconformances_` in `SMK-NEW_HTML/form_086_logic.js`.
    *   **Outcome:** Form 086 submission worked correctly.

2.  **Project Status Reversion Logic (after 086 closure):**
    *   **Problem:** After closing a Nonconformance Protocol (086), the project status was not reverting from "Стоп-ПН" to its `status_before_incident`.
    *   **Initial Diagnosis:** Gemini explained the existing logic: status reverts only if *all* associated incidents (086 and 085) are closed.
    *   **Deeper Dive:** User confirmed no other open incidents. Log analysis showed `status_before_incident` was empty for the project `ИЦ-Н-2509-05`.
    *   **User Correction:** User identified that the script was looking for project data in the wrong row (row 24 instead of row 23) in the `081-01` table.

3.  **Centralizing Project Row Index (Patch Applied):**
    *   **Decision:** To address the incorrect row indexing, a patch was proposed and applied to centralize the determination of the project's `rowIndex`.
    *   **Mechanism:** The `getProjectDataById_` function was modified to reliably return the `rowIndex` (1-based index). All functions interacting with project statuses (`updateProjectStatus_`, `saveStatusBeforeIncident_`, `clearStatusBeforeIncident_`, `getSavedStatusBeforeIncident_`) were updated to explicitly accept and use this `rowIndex`.
    *   **Outcome:** User confirmed that closing Form 086 worked correctly after this patch.

4.  **Form 085 File Attachment Fix:**
    *   **Problem:** When submitting Form 085, links to attached files were not being saved in the `085` table.
    *   **Fix:** Modified `writeForm085ComplaintDataToSheet_` in `SMK-NEW_HTML/form_085_logic.js` to correctly pass and record `uploadedFileUrls` into the "Прикрепить фото/видео от клиента" column.
    *   **Outcome:** Fix applied.

5.  **Form 085 Project Status Update Debugging:**
    *   **Problem:** Project status in `081-01` was not changing to "РЕКЛАМАЦИЯ" upon new Form 085 submission.
    *   **Initial Misdiagnosis:** Gemini initially suspected missing column headers, but user confirmed their presence.
    *   **Debugging Step:** Added detailed logging to `submitForm085Complaint` (before calling `updateProjectStatus_`) and within `updateProjectStatus_` itself to trace `projectId`, `newStatus`, and `projectRowIndex`.
    *   **Log Analysis:** User provided a log which showed a message: `Рекламация по проекту ИЦ-Н-2509-05 не закрыта успешно. Статус проекта не изменен.`. This message originates from the *editing* logic (when `finalStatus` is not 'Закрыта (успешно)'), not the *new complaint creation* logic. Crucially, the debug logs added in the previous patch for the new complaint creation path (`DEBUG: (Before updateProjectStatus_ in 085 new)`) were *missing* from the user's log.
    *   **Conclusion:** The most likely cause is that the latest script changes (specifically, the added logging and potentially other logic for new complaints) were not correctly deployed or cached in Google Apps Script.

#### Files Modified:

*   `SMK-NEW_HTML/form_086_logic.js` (initial fix, then part of row index patch)
*   `SMK-NEW_HTML/1_utilities.js` (centralizing row index, logging for 085 status)
*   `SMK-NEW_HTML/form_081_logic.js` (part of row index patch)
*   `SMK-NEW_HTML/form_084_logic.js` (part of row index patch)
*   `SMK-NEW_HTML/form_085_logic.js` (part of row index patch, file attachment fix, logging for 085 status)

#### Unresolved Questions / Next Steps:

*   **Crucial Next Step:** The primary task for the next session is to ensure that the latest changes to the Google Apps Script project are **fully and correctly deployed**. You need to force a new version deployment in the Google Apps Script editor.
*   **Re-test:** After successful deployment, re-test the submission of a new Form 085 to see if the project status updates to "РЕКЛАМАЦИЯ" and if the new debug logs appear in the execution log.
